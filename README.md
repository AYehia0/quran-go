This application is built-with the really nice TUI package : [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

## TODO
The application is in very early stage of development, with messy code and many copy-paste code from docs lol.

- [ ] Add Double Pane (book-like)
- [ ] Optimize the page search by sorting
- [ ] Re-Organize the `tea` (The Elm Architecture)
- [ ] Add themes :D
- [ ] Select Ayah and add to bookmark
- [ ] Search Ayah
- [ ] Highlight Ayah
